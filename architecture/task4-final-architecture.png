## 📐 Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the full traffic inspection path across GCP using FortiGate NGFW:

[ Internet ]
↓
[ External Load Balancer (ELB) ]
↓
[ FortiGate NGFW ]
↓ port1
[ VIP: ELB_IP → 10.0.0.2 ]
↓ port2
[ frontend-vm (10.0.0.2) ]
↔ (via FortiGate port2)
[ backend-vm (10.0.1.2) ]


**VPC Layout:**
- `frontend-vm` resides in `frontend VPC`
- `backend-vm` resides in `backend VPC`
- FortiGate resides in `hub VPC`
- All traffic is routed and inspected through FortiGate NGFW
